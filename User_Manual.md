# Non-Restoring Unsigned division simulator

Welcome! This is a simulator that perfrom non-restoring division for unsigned integers.\
This simulator performs non-restoring unsigned divison using either decimal or binary integers.\
Trace the solution by using our built in step-by-step function. You can also view the full solution immediately by selecting the All mode.\
The solution can also be saved as a text file.\

## How to use:

### Select Type of Integer:
Choose the type of unsigned integer you would want to solve. By default, the simulator solves decimal integers.\
You may select between Decimal/Binary integers.

### Type in your Inputs:

1) Input the dividend digit.
2) Input the divisor digit. 

Note: Input should be based on your selected type of digit.

### Select solution Type:
 
Select between Step-by-step or All solution mode.
***Step-by-step***
- Selecting this option display the solution step-by-step.
- Click the "Next" button to proceed to the next step.
